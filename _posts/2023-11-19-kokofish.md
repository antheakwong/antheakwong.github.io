Fish form inspired by Kokomi from Genshin Impact (lovingly dubbed Kokofish). Experimenting with Angelina Fibers mixed into wool to give a bit of sparkle texture. Coral also made from scratch out of wire and wool. Base stand made with a wood base painted with acrylic and acrylic rods bent into U shapes to hold up fish. <br>
