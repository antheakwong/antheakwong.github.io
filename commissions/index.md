# Commissions Info

My commissions are closed indefinitely due to time constraints and full time work sorry! 

**Contact me through [twitter DMs](https://twitter.com/aysrin) or [email](mailto: anthea.wh.kwong@gmail.com)(anthea.wh.kwong@gmail.com) if you have any project requests or have any questions!**

**How to get started:**

- Include all visual references and details about the characters. Be as specific as possible.

- Payment upfront via paypal (I will send an invoice)

    - I will start drawing once I receive payment

    - If for any reason I am unable to complete your commission, you will be refunded in full.


**Terms of Service:**
- I have the right to post any commissioned work on my social media unless otherwise requested. (posts will be watermarked/lower resolution)

- You are not permitted to redistribute the commission for profit or claim credit for my work. 

    - You may repost the commission as long as credit and a link to my work is included (eg., tagging my handle @aysrin).

- I reserve the right to refuse any commissions with content that I may find uncomfortable.
